# nrf51_BLE_MESH
This was an experimental code to test how to transfer messages &amp; ack over BLE advertisments from nodes to Gateway.
A simple protocol. 

This is done on arduino Core with nrf51 modules.
here is a bad quality vidoe of that time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K9LLiZyyr8
Its  one & 1/2 year old project.

I would try to document the protocol some day When I am free and getting bored.
